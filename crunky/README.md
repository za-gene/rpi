# crunky

> 32 bits ought to be enough for anyone


Attempt to build a "unikernel" for Raspberry Pi 0.

The Pi0 has an ARM11 core using the ARMv6 ISA (Instruction Set Architecture).

An ARM processor that supports ARMv8 has 4 exception levels ([link](https://s-matyukevich.github.io/raspberry-pi-os/docs/lesson02/rpi-os.html)).

## setup

Define the environment variable CRUNKY in your .bashrc file:
```
export CRUNKY=/path/to/crunky
```


## Dissasembly

One of 
```
aarch64-linux-gnu-objdump -D kernel8.elf | less
arm-none-eabi-objdump -D kernel.elf 
```

## ctype headers

Including the standard `ctype.h` header give wierd errors about
```
kernel.c:(.text+0x98): undefined reference to `_ctype_'

```

Include the `ctype1.h` library instead.


## FAT32 and SD

Adapted from https://github.com/bztsrc/raspi3-tutorial

File reading is in example 21. It crashes, though. It's clear that there's support for reading, though.
The use of memory is very suspicious for fat.c. Create a file called `test.txt` on the first FAT32
partition. You should see at least some dumping out of the contents of the file.
